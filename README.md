# CS-180-project
## Introduction

In the digital age, social interaction platforms have transcended traditional communication barriers, enabling people from all over the world to connect, share, and engage with content in real-time. Recognizing the pivotal role these platforms play in today's social fabric, our Java project team is excited to embark on creating a robust, user-friendly social interaction platform. This platform is designed to foster a dynamic community where users can effortlessly interact and express themselves. The project encapsulates several critical features that aim to provide a comprehensive social experience tailored to meet the diverse needs of its users.

**New User Account Creation and Secure Login:** At the heart of our platform is a user-friendly interface for account creation, ensuring a smooth and welcoming entry point for new users. Security is paramount; therefore, each account will be safeguarded with password-protected logins, ensuring that user data remains secure and private.

**Interactive Post and Feed System:** Central to our platform is the ability to make posts and display them in a personalized feed. This feed will not only show the user's own posts but also aggregate and display posts from their friends, creating a continuous stream of content that is relevant and engaging.

**Engagement Tools:** To foster interaction, our platform will include mechanisms for upvoting or downvoting posts, which helps in curating content quality and relevance. Users can also hide posts from their feed, allowing for a customizable content experience. Comments on posts further engage the community, allowing for discussions and interactions within the content shared. Any user can upvote or downvote comments, contributing to the community moderation of the content. Importantly, post owners and comment creators will have the authority to delete comments to manage the interactions on their contributions effectively.

In conclusion, our project is not just about coding a platform but about creating a vibrant community where users feel secure, connected, and engaged. By implementing these features, we aim to build a comprehensive social interaction platform that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of todayâ€™s digital natives. Through this project, we are excited to contribute to the evolving landscape of social media platforms, where technology meets human interaction.

## GUI
### Instruction for compiling:

1. Click run button on your IDE for Server.java
2. Run CLientGUI.java to get started.
2. Run ClientGUI.java to get started.
3. You can check the userFile.txt to login with an exist account or create a new account.
4. Check the main menu on our GUI panel to play with all functions we have shown on the buttons.
5. After finishing all you want to do, you will go back to the main menu and click logout, then confirm the logout information to exist the whole program successfully.


## Database

### Testing Notes:
  #### AccountDatabase.java and AccountMod.java are the same thing, but one is for testing for the test case to make sure all methods work, one will be implemented as the primary code which runs in the main method.
  
  Testing will take place in two different locations for the user data for accounts. We will have UserDatabase.Java and Accounts.Java tested in the UserDatabaseTest class. The test handling checks if the methods in both classes work together, which helps assist in the confirmation  of all methods working. If you want to test it manually, the database for all modifications of the Account class will be accessible in the main method, and file output will still be present to be checked.
 
  ### Instructions for Compiling:
  1. Compile all the interface files
  2. Compile Account, Post, and Replies
  3. Compile the rest of the other classes (except for Main.java and MainPost.java)
  4. Compile the Main classes

  An automatic test through running the RunLocalTest.java file would check each method from the Account and AccountDatabase class as well as the test for the Post and Replies methods. We've also included two manual tests in the form of Main.java and MainPost.java that check for account/post creation success in the text files. The manual tests take inputs and create new Accounts/Posts/Replies that can be stored in the textfiles.


As our project aims to build a fully functional Social Media Platform from the ground up, we focus initially on the database side. Our goal is to create a robust and efficient database capable of managing user data, interactions, and content in a thread-safe manner. This database will serve as the backbone for a social media application, supporting features like user profiles, friend interactions, content posting, and more.

- Database Design Considerations
  - Data Storage: Deciding on the structure for storing user profiles, friend relationships, posts, comments, and reactions.
  - Access Patterns: Efficiently accessing and updating user data, posts, and interactions.
  - Concurrency Control: Techniques to ensure thread safety, allowing the server to interact with multiple clients simultaneously without data corruption or loss.
  - Scalability: Designing the database to efficiently handle growth in the number of users and their interactions.

- Relationships:
  - Implements the **IPost** interface. Uses the javax.xml.stream.events. Comment for managing comments within a post.
  - Interact with Replies.java. While **Post.java** manages the core details and interactions of a social media post, **Replies.java** complements it by managing the replies associated with each post. Each reply in **Replies.java** is linked to a post through the postID, allowing for a structured and interconnected social media interaction model. This allows for a hierarchical structure where posts can have multiple replies, and each reply is directly associated with its parent post.

 ### Replies.java

 Replies.java is a Java class dedicated to managing replies to social media posts. It supports operations such as creating, deleting, and modifying replies, in addition to handling upvotes and downvotes on each reply. This class is designed to work in conjunction with Post.java to offer a comprehensive system for post and reply interactions within a social media framework.

- Testing: Conducted with JUnit to verify accurate functionality for creating, deleting, and modifying replies. Ensures upvote and downvote actions are correctly recorded and associated with the right user and reply.
- Features:
  - Creation, deletion, and modification of replies.
  - Mechanisms for upvoting and downvoting replies.
  - Association of replies to their respective posts via postID.
- Relationships:
  - Implements the **IReplies** interface. Uses the javax.xml.stream.events. Comment for managing comments within a post.
  - Directly associated with **Post.java** through the post, establishing a clear connection between replies and their parent posts.
  - Enhances Post.java's functionality by adding depth to post interactions, allowing users to respond to posts with replies, which can themselves be upvoted or downvoted.

  ### AccountInfo
  AccountInfo.java is a Java class that extends off of Account.java. AccountInfo includes all the miscellaneous details of the Account such as birthdays and pronouns. We will implement this to our project in the future when we ask for user information in the later phases.
  
  ### LogIn
  LogIn.java is a Java class that is used to help facilitate the process of managing Accounts that would be stored via the AccountDatabase class. It's used in conjunction with the Main.java file to create, login, and to check whether the account exists the text file or not. This class also implements the ILogIn interface.

  ### Utils
  Utils.java is a Java class that we use to translate data stored as Strings in the database into an ArrayList and vice versa. It has methods that are used throughout other classes that need to access .txt files.

  ### BadDataException
  BadDataException was created to report bad data when handling inputs. It extends off of the Exception class and has a String field that says what input error caused the exception to be thrown, this is only for the test case since all data will be processed by the server before entering the txt file.

### MainMerge
The main merge is the most basic and important function to get combined functionality.It can login or create an account, and also post and reply to the post. We put all required functions for this project in readme and **we will merge it into GUI later for phase 3.**
